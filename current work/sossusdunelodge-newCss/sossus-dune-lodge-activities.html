        <p>
          <strong>Sossusvlei </strong>
          is a region of the southern Namib with
          homogeneous features extending between Koichab and Kuiseb Rivers.
          This area is characterized by high sand dunes of vivid
          pink-to-orange color, a consequence of a high percentage of iron in
          the sand and consequent oxidation processes. These dunes are among
          the highest in the world; with the highest being the Big
          Daddy, about 380 meters high.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sesriem Canyon</strong>
          is a natural canyon carved by the Tsauchab River in the local
          sedimentary rock, about 1 km long and up to 30 meters deep.

        <h3>Self Exploration</h3>
        <p>Because of it's location inside the park <strong>Sossus Dune
            Lodge</strong>
          is one of the best lodges for self-drive visitors to catch
          the early morning sunrays on the dunes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Photography</strong> The stunning scenery of the Namib's
          high red &amp; orange sand dunes in the Naukluft Park is one of the
          best sights of Southern Africa &#8211; it's a 'must see' for all
          professional and keen photographers.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Dune 45</strong> and the <strong>Petrified dunes</strong> -
          Dune 45 is so called because it lies 45 km past Sesriem on the road
          to Sossusvlei. It is also known as &quot;the most photographed dune
          in the world&quot;; because of its unusually simple and fascinating
          shape. Petrified dunes are found in several places in the Sossusvlei
          area. They are very ancient (billions of years old) red sand dunes
          that have solidified to rock.

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Deadvlei </strong> is another popular clay pan, about 2 km
          from Sossusvlei. A notable feature of Deadvlei is that it used to be
          an oasis with several acacia trees; afterwards, the river that
          watered the oasis changed its course.
        </p>
        <p>Deadvlei pan is thus punctuated by blackened, dead acacia trees, in
          vivid contrast to the shiny white of the salty floor of the pan and
          the intense orange of the dunes. This creates a particularly
          fascinating and surrealistic landscape, that appears in uncountable
          pictures and that has been used as a setting for films and videos
          (e.g, The Cell, a Hollywood motion picture
          starring Jennifer Lopez).
